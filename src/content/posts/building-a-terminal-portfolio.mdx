I've always been drawn to terminal aesthetics. There's something satisfying about the simplicity of a command line interface - just text, no distractions.

## The Stack

This site is built with:

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for blazing fast builds
- **MDX** for blog posts
- **Shiki** for syntax highlighting

No CSS frameworks, no component libraries. Just hand-crafted CSS with CSS variables for theming.

## Design Decisions

### Color Palette

The color scheme is built around forest green (emerald) shades:

```css
--emerald-400: #34d399;
--emerald-500: #10b981;
--emerald-600: #059669;
```

### Typography

Everything uses the system monospace font stack:

```css
--font-mono: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace;
```

This means the site looks native on every platform without loading any custom fonts.

### The Terminal Window

The terminal window component is the heart of the design. It features:

- Three dots (in green shades instead of the typical red/yellow/green)
- A centered title bar showing the current "path"
- Content area with proper spacing

## Performance

Without any heavy dependencies, the site loads fast:

- No tracking scripts
- No external fonts
- Minimal JavaScript
- Lazy-loaded images

## Open Source

The source code is available on GitHub. Feel free to use it as inspiration for your own terminal-themed projects.
