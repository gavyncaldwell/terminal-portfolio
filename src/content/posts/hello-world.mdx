Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is where I'll be sharing thoughts on software development, homelab adventures, and whatever else catches my interest.

## Why a Terminal Theme?

I spend most of my day in the terminal. Between Neovim, tmux, lazygit, and various CLI tools, the command line feels like home. So why not make my website feel the same way?

The design is intentionally minimal:

- No tracking or analytics
- No cookies
- Fast load times
- Self-hosted

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

1. **Development** - React, TypeScript, and frontend architecture
2. **Tooling** - My development setup and workflow
3. **Homelab** - Self-hosting, Docker, and infrastructure
4. **Random Interests** - Coffee, cars, and whatever else
